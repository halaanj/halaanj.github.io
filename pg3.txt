            <p>The statue of Ramesses || is a 3200 year old figure of Ramses ||, the third king of 
            the 19th dynasty of ancient Egypt. He ruled Egypt from 1279-13 BCE and his reign 
            was the second longest in Egyptian history. This statue shows the conventional

            name, wearing the royal nemes headdress with a cobra and a false beard. </p>

             Caviglia at the great temple of Ptah close to 
              Memphis, Egypt. It is made from red granite and
