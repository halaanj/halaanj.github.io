            <p >Napoleon Crossing the Alps (also known as Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass or Bonaparte Crossing the 
                Alps; listed as Le Premier Consul franchissant les Alpes au col du Grand Saint-Bernard) is a collection
                 of five oil on canvas equestrian portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte painted between 1801 and 1805 by the 
                 French artist Jacques Louis David. The composition, which was commissioned by the King of Spain, depicts
                  a highly idealized view of Napoleon and his army's actual crossing of the Alps through the Great St Bernard Passin May 1800. 
                It has become one of Napoleon's most widely reproduced images.Bonaparte appears mounted in a general-in-uniform, chief's wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne and wielding a Mamluk-style sabre. 
                He is encircled by the folds of a large cloak that billows in the breeze. His head is turned to the viewer, and he motions
                 with his right hand toward the mountain's summit. His left hand is gripping the reins of his horse. The horse stands on its 
                 hind legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. A line of soldiers, 
                 interspersed with artillery, makes its way up the mountain in the background. Dark clouds hang over the image, and mountains
                  rise sharply in front of Bonaparte. When i first saw this painting i was in awe of all the colors and how the artist wanted 
                  to show an environment where there is war and force. In this drawing the colors are warm
                   and dark which gives stormy weather. also the Artist wanted to show the feeling of the man 
                   which is excited and happy. there is also movement with the horse going forward. there are 
                   a lot of details , shading in colors and source of lights. </p>
