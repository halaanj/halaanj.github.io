           <p>The statue of Ramesses || is a 3200 year old figure of Ramses ||, The third king
                 of Egypt's 19th dynasty (1292–1190 BCE), whose reign (1279–13 BCE) was the second
                  longest in Egyptian history. In addition to his wars with the Hittites and the 
                  Libyans, he is known for his extensive building programs and the numerous colossal
                   statues of him that can be found throughout Egypt. Perhaps none of the Egyptian
                    pharaohs has been as productive as Ramses II. Ramses II was the pharaoh who had 
                    one of the longest recorded reigns — 67 years — fought more battles, produced more
                     statuary, and built more buildings than any other ruler of ancient Egypt.  He was 
                     also the most prodigious ruler, having fathered the most children of any king. 
                     Ramses II is often referred to as the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Ramses II was a world-renowned 
                     builder who was enthralled by architecture. During his 66-year reign, he masterfully crafted 
                     and rebuilt numerous monuments, structures, and temples. The massive temples of Abu Simbel 
                     and Ramesseum are two of his most well-known works. In terms of size, design, and complexity,
                      both of these monuments represent a new architectural style. Furthermore, the giant statue of Ramses II is a feature shared by both of these temples.The Egyptian archaeological 
                     and textual sources, on the other hand, are deafeningly silent on the subject. Ramses died 
                     in the sixty-seventh year of his reign, likely a few years after reaching the age of ninety.  
                     In terms of achievements, he may be considered one of the most powerful and effective rulers 
                     of the ancient world. Merenptah, his thirteenth son, succeeded him.It was discovered in 1820 
                     by Giovanni Battisa Caviglia at the great temple of Ptah close to  Memphis, Egypt. It is made 
                     from red granite and weighs 83 tons.This statue shows the conventional pose that indicates his
                      roles as pharaoh, seated on a throne inscribed with his name, wearing the royal nemes headdress 
                      with a cobra and a false beard.
