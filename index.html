            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Louvre Abu Dhabi is an art museum in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, located on Saadiyat
                 Island. It operates under an agreement signed in March 2007 between the UAE and France that
                  allows it to use the Louvre's name until 2037, and has been described by the Louvre as "France's
                   largest cultural project abroad." It is approximately 24,000 square metres (260,000 sq ft) in 
                   size, with 8,000 square metres (86,000 sq ft) of galleries, making it the Arabian peninsula's 
                   largest art museum. The museum exhibits artworks from all over the world, with the stated goal 
                   of bridging the gap between Eastern and Western art. The Louvre Abu Dhabi had already received 
                   2 million visitors by 2019, making it the most visited museum in the Arab world.</p>

            <h3>Jean Nouvel's vision</h3>
             <p>The Louvre Abu Dhabi was built as the heart of a new urban quarter for the capital city 
                 of the United Arab Emirates, thanks to architect Jean Nouvel's unique vision. The museum's 
                 design was inspired by the region's rich architectural traditions as well as the museum's 
                 unique location at the point where the Arabian sky meets the sands of Saadiyat Island and the 
                 waters of the Arabian Gulf. The Louvre Abu Dhabi, now regarded as one of the world's modern urban 
                 wonders, is not only the Arab world's first universal museum, but also a powerful symbol of the 
                 United Arab Emirates' ambition and achievement.</p>

                <img src="FFJBE3518.JPG" width="200" height="300" class="center" alt="dome">

                    <h3>architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The dome consists of eight different layers: Four outer layers clad in stainless steel and four inner
                 layers clad in aluminum separated by a steel frame five meters high. Nouvel's vision is centered on a
                  massive silvery dome that appears to float above the museum-city. Despite its appearance of 
                 weightlessness, the dome weighs approximately 7,500 tonnes (similar to the Eiffel Tower in Paris).   
                Nouvel's dome is a complex, geometric structure of 7,850 stars inspired by the cupola, a distinguishing 
                feature in Arabic architecture. These stars are repeated in eight different layers at various sizes and 
                angles. As the sun passes overhead, its light filters through the perforations in the dome, creating an 
                enchanting effect known as the 'rain of light' within the museum. The palm trees of Abu Dhabi inspired
                 this ode to nature. Their leaves filter and soften the direct sunlight, creating a dappled pattern on the ground.
                 From 2013 to 2017, the museum was under construction. Prior to completion, the Louvre Abu Dhabi received three
                  international awards: winner of the Identity Design Award's 'Project of the Future' category in 2015; the European 
                  Steel Design Award in 2017, received in collaboration with Waagner Biro, the Louvre Abu Dhabi dome specialist; 
                  and winner of the Identity Design Award's 'Most Prominent UAE Project' category in 2017.
